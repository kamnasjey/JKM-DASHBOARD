## Overview

This repository will stay in sync with your deployed chats on [v0.app](https://v0.app).
Any changes you make to your deployed app will be automatically pushed to this repository from [v0.app](https://v0.app).

## Deployment

## How It Works

1. Create and modify your project using [v0.app](https://v0.app)
2. Deploy your chats from the v0 interface
3. Changes are automatically pushed to this repository
4. Vercel deploys the latest version from this repository

## Environment variables

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE`: Backend API base URL (e.g. `https://api.jkmcopilot.com`).
  - If not set, the app falls back to `https://api.jkmcopilot.com`.
- Legacy fallback: `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` is also supported.
